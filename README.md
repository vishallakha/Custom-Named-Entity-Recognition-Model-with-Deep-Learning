## Description
In this project i have trained a custom Named Entity Recognition Model, which takes input of strings (max size 40) and predicts the Named Entities from the text. It used ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) , bi directional LSTM and a time distributed dense layer.

## Technology Stack
Python, Keras, Tensorflow, LSTM
